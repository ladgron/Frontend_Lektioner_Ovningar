The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
Note: You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
-->
<!--
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.
It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE html>
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="sv">

The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<h1>My First Heading</h1>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Exempel 5</title>
</head>

<!--The <body> element defines the document's body. It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
The <h1> element defines a heading.
The <p> element defines a paragraph.
